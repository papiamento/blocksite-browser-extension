# blocksite-browser-extension

In order to change your browsing addiction, you may need to block websites
that you have been conditioned to visit regularly as part of an involuntary
compulsion. 

For me that site is cnn.com, which I used to visit multiple times a day 
without even knowing that I was doing it. 

After using a few site blocking extensions, I started getting suspicious
about the code that runs these extensions. Extensions apparently have 
access to the whole DOM tree of any page you load. That's scary, because
who knows what information these extensions can collect from you. 

This extension is open-source, and doesn't collect any information from 
the sites that you are visiting, or your browsing behavior.
